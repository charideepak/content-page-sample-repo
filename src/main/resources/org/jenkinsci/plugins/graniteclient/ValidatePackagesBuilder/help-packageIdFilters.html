<div>
    Specify a list of package ID filters to match against identified Vault packages located in
    the workspace. Each filter string must occupy its own line.<br/>
    <br/>
    A Package ID consists of the group, the name, and the version of a package, separated by
    colons (':').<br/>
    <br/>
    Package ID filters must follow one of three patterns:<br/>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <tt>group:name:version</tt>
        </li>
        <li>
            <tt>group:name</tt>
        </li>
        <li>
            <tt>name</tt>
        </li>
    </ul>
    Each segment in the package ID filter may be either ommitted or replaced with an asterisk ('*') to
    represent a wildcard.<br/>
    <br/>
    This step now supports path filters as well. A path filter is a path suffix relative to the localDirectory ending in '.zip' or '.jar', which may include '**', '*', and '?' wildcard characters.<br/>
    <br/>
    For example, this pattern will match all zip files under the Local Directory:<br/>
    <br/>
    <pre>
        **/*.zip
    </pre>
    This pattern will only match packages located directly under the Packages folder whose filenames begin with 'acme-':<br/>
    <br/>
    <pre>
        Packages/acme-*.zip
    </pre>
    Matching packages will be validated in the order in which the filters are specified. At least one package must match each filter or the step will fail.<br/>
    <br/>
    This field supports parameter tokens.
