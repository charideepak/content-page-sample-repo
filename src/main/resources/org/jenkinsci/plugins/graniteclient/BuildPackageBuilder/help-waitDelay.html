<div>
    Specify a delay in milliseconds before calls to check for Package Manager service availability. Increase this value if a /crx/packmgr node is sometimes created in the repository by this step, indicating that the Package Manager servlet was brought down for bundle installation AFTER a successful check for service availability, but BEFORE the next POST request was sent. What happens is that the SlingPostServlet takes over when the crx-packagemgr bundle is refreshed and creates nodes for any POST requests that it handles. Increasing this delay gives more time for the bundle refresh process to begin on the server.
