<div>
    Specify a package workspace filter in a simple text format that will be applied to
    the package before build. This defines what content will be captured by the package.<br/>
    <br/>
    Simple spec is defined simply as a line-by-line format where:<br/>
    <ul>
        <li>each line consists of significant text before an optional comment character (#)</li>
        <li>each line that begins with a "/" begins a new filter root.</li>
        <li>the first non-empty, non-comment line must define a new filter root</li>
        <li>each non-empty, non-comment line after a filter root that begins with a "+" or "-" defines an include or exclude rule, respectively. Everything following the "+" or "-" must be a valid regular expression</li>
    </ul>
    Content is "covered" by a filter root if the content path starts with, or is the same as the filter root path. Once the "covering" filter root is identified, its include/exclude rules are evaluated from top to bottom, by matching the content path against each rule pattern (which is a Java regular expression). The last rule whose pattern matches the content
    path defines whether that content is included (line starts with "+") or excluded (line starts with "-"). If no rules are defined, all content covered by that root path is included<br/>
    <br/>
    For example, to include everything under /etc except for packages:<br/>
    <br/>
    <pre>
        /etc                 # define /etc as the filter root
        +/etc(/.*)?          # include everything under /etc
        -/etc/packages(/.)?  # exclude package paths
    </pre>
    To create a package for a project "acme" defined in CRX DE Lite, a filter may look like this:<br/>
    <br/>
    <pre>
        /content/acme        # include the site content
        /apps/acme           # include the app code
    </pre>
    This field supports parameter tokens.
