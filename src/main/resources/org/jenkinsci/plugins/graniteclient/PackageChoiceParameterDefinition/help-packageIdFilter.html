<div>
    Specify a package ID filter to match against the list of packages returned from the configured Granite server.<br/>
    <br/>
    A Package ID consists of the group, the name, and the version of a package, separated by
    colons (':').<br/>
    <br/>
    Package ID filters must follow one of three patterns:<br/>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <tt>group:name:version</tt>
        </li>
        <li>
            <tt>group:name</tt>
        </li>
        <li>
            <tt>name</tt>
        </li>
    </ul>
    Each segment in the filter may be either ommitted or replaced with an asterisk ('*') to
    represent a wildcard.
