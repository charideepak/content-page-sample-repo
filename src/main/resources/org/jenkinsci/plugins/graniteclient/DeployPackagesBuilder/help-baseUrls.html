<div>
    Specify the base URL of the Adobe Granite server, including hostname and port.
    The CRX Package Manager service path will be appended to this value for all requests.
    For example, <strong>http://localhost:4502</strong> or <strong>https://author.mycorp.com</strong>,
    etc.<br/>
    <br/>
    Multiple urls can be specified, one per line. All specified packages will be deployed to one
    server before beginning deployments to the next one.<br/>
    <br/>
    If login credentials for one of the servers are different than those configured in the Connection Options section,
    you may override them in the Base URL by inserting <code>username[:password]@</code> between the scheme and
    the hostname.<br/>
    <br/>
    For example, to override the Username without changing the associated password or private key, you may use the
    following form:<br/>
    <br/>
    http://<strong>deployer@</strong>localhost:4502<br/>
    <br/>
    To override the credentials completely, provide a username and password (which may be provided by an encrypted
    parameter) by separating them with a colon, as shown below:<br/>
    <br/>
    http://<strong>deployer:Password123@</strong>localhost:4502<br/>
    <br/>
    This field supports parameter tokens.
