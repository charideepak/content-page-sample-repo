<div>
    Enable preemptive Basic Authentication for the Base URLs matching any of these patterns (one regular expression per
    line). Any build step's connection to a CRX server whose configured base URL matches one of these patterns will
    skip the login request and assume the basic credentials are correct.<br/>
    <br/>
    For example, a value of <code>^https://</code> will enable preemptive authentication for all encrypted server
    base URLs, whereas a more specific pattern of <code>http://author.corp.com:4502</code> will only enable preemptive
    auth for a single host.<br/>
    <br/>
    WARNING: If misused or used incorrectly the preemptive authentication can lead to significant security issues,
    such as sending user credentials in clear text to an unauthorized third party. Therefore, users are expected to
    evaluate potential benefits of preemptive authentication versus security risks in the context of their specific
    application environment.<br/>
    <br/>
    Connections configured to use <strong>[Signature]</strong> credentials are not affected by this configuration.
